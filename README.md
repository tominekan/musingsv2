# Musings v2.0

This is a rebuild of my simple blog website. 
We're using Bootstrap + Django for our tech stack (for now).

I'm switching from JAMStack to some "actual" code to sharpen my technical skills. In additon, I have a lot more control over how it looks like.

I use `django-bootsteap-v5` to assist with some useful stuff.
